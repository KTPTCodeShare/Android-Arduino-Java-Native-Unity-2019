# Android-Arduino (Java-Native-Unity)
 Once up on a time, I had to figure out the way for my smartphone, which host a VR game developed in Unity, to Send and Received Serial data from a connected Arduino board via OTG. I then used Java native application with function to open a serial connection, read and write data. On the Unity side, I had a C# script to load an output .jar file from this project. The script read and wrote data and sent data back and forth with the smartphone and Arudino Board.
